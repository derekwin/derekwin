### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ I am an [EngD](https://www.discoverphds.com/advice/doctorates/professional-doctorates) student from the [IIC Laboratory](https://iic.sdu.edu.cn/news.htm) at the School of Computer Science and Technology, [Shandong University](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/). My research interests include CloudNative and High-Performance Communication Network Technology for Data Centers.
- ðŸ”­ I received my master's degree from [Changchun University of Science and Technology](https://www.cust.edu.cn/). During my master's studies, my research focused on network protocols (such as multi-path transport protocol and congestion control algorithms) and artificial intelligence algorithms (including how AI technology can empower networks, DRL, MARL, etc.) : [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NetExperimentEasy).
- ðŸ”­ Before my master's, I worked as an independent full stack developer (using Django, FastAPI, Vue, and Flutter) and participated in web security CTFs. My main programming languages are Python, C, and Go.
- ðŸ¤” I am also an open source contributor to [OpenEuler#sig-high-performance-network](https://gitee.com/openeuler/oncn-bwm) and [Kmesh](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh).
- ðŸŒ± I am passionate and self-motivated when it comes to technology and research.

History:
- [x] Robust and friendly congestion control algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning. I have implemented a robust reinforcement learning-based congestion control scheme on both tcp and xquic protocols, and have derived a complete set of software and tools for research in this area.
