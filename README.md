### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ I am studying for a master's degree at Changchun University of Science and Technology.
- ðŸ”­ My research interests are network protocols (multi-path transport protocol, congestion control algorithms) and artificial intelligence algorithms (how artificial intelligence technology can empower networks, DRL, MARL etc.).
- ðŸŒ± Before my masters, I was an independent full stack developer (django, fastapi, vue, flutter) and web security CTFer. My main languages now are Python, C and Go.
- ðŸ¤” I am a passionate and self-motivated person for technology and research.~I am actively seeking a PhD or Job position(Fall 2024)~ : ). My future research direction will shift to cloud computing security, ebpf, etc.
- ðŸŒˆ Be my friend? Jacelau@outlook.com
- ðŸ‘¯ Have a good day! :)
- I've been mainly maintaining a repository for network research lately. https://github.com/NetExperimentEasy

TODO list
- [x] Robust and friendly congestion control algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning. I have implemented a robust reinforcement learning-based congestion control scheme on both tcp and xquic protocols, and have derived a complete set of software and tools for research in this area. If you are interested, feel free to contact me.
