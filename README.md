### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ I am studying for a master's degree at Changchun University of Science and Technology.
- ðŸ”­ My research interests are network protocols (multi-path transmission protocols, congestion control algorithms) and artificial intelligence algorithms (how artificial intelligence technology can empower networks, DRL, MARL etc.).
- ðŸŒ± Before my masters, I was an independent full stack developer(django, fastapi, vue, flutter). My main languages are Python and C now.
- ðŸ¤” I am a passionate and self-motivated person for technology and research.I am actively seeking a PhD position(Fall 2024) for further research on networks and artificial intelligence algorithms.
