### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ I am studying for a master's degree at Changchun University of Science and Technology.
- ðŸ”­ My research interests are network protocols (multi-path transport protocol, congestion control algorithms) and artificial intelligence algorithms (how artificial intelligence technology can empower networks, DRL, MARL etc.).
- ðŸŒ± Before my masters, I was an independent full stack developer (django, fastapi, vue, flutter) and web security CTFer. My main languages now are Python, C and Go.
- ðŸ¤” I am a passionate and self-motivated person for technology and research.I am actively seeking a PhD or Job position(Fall 2024).
- ðŸŒˆ Be my friend? Jacelau@outlook.com
- ðŸ‘¯ Have a good day! :)
- I've been mainly maintaining a repository for network research lately. https://github.com/NetExperimentEasy

The deep reinforcement learning research environment for congestion control has been developed and improved (including the xquic based interface and test program, the parallel network training ground based on the network simulator, and the gym api based reinforcement learning environment). If you are interested in conducting research with me, please email me.

TODO ing
- [ ] Robust and friendly congestion control algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning.
- [ ] dollop : a Streaming concurrent server framework based on quic(quic-go). QUIC-based Decentralized Distributed gaming framework.
- [ ] ooquic : Quic protocol implementation (golang) that supports plug-in congestion control and is friendly to extensions and new features.
